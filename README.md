## Design Keynotes
- **Gradient Colors**:
  - Matches exactly as mentioned in the API docs.
- **Hero Transition**:
  - From the New Post Box on the home screen to the main New Post Screen, a hero transition ensures the user feels they are typing in the same text field.
- **Feed Post Design**:
  - Multiple images are perfectly centered with a border radius while maintaining the original ratio.
  - Feed post main content text size is adaptable to the length of the post. Short posts appear with larger fonts, enhancing readability.
  - For the feed post that has background color, will be applied with different constraints, such as minimum height has been set (As same approach as facebook.com).
- **User Profile Integration**:
  - Every post and comment shows its creatorâ€™s user profile picture fetched from the API endpoint.
- **Handled Scenarios**:
  - Supports all feed post scenarios:
    - Only image, only text, image with small text, image with larger text, text with background color, and text/image with background color.
- **Reaction Panel**:
  - Long pressing on the Like button expands the full reaction panel.

## Functionalities Keynotes
- **Dynamic Feed Updates**:
  - Feed dynamically updates at certain intervals in the background.
- **Thread Management**:
  - The feed fetching process runs in a different thread, ensuring smooth app execution.
- **Instant Updates**:
  - Like and comment counts update instantly and reflect past actions.
    - Example: If the user has already liked a post, the LIKE button is highlighted, and the user can remove the reaction by clicking it again. This works for other reactions as well.
- **Comment Likes**:
  - Not implemented due to the absence of an API endpoint.
- **Replies**:
  - Replies are collapsed by default. Clicking on them loads and displays the replies.
  - This approach reduces the number of read requests and prevents unnecessary user distractions.
